## 2. Find the top 3 highest-paid employees in each department.
## Uses RANK() to rank employees based on salary and filters top 3.
--select employee_id,salary,department_id
from (
select employee_id,salary,department_id, rank() over 
(partition by department_id order by salary desc)
as salary_rank from hr.employees
) where salary_rank<=3;

## 3. Identify the second highest salary in each department using DENSE_RANK().
## Uses DENSE_RANK() to identify employees with the second-highest salary per department.
select employee_id,salary,department_id,salary_rank
from (
select employee_id,salary,department_id, dense_rank() over 
(partition by department_id order by salary desc)
as salary_rank from hr.employees
) where salary_rank=4;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ## 4. Identify the fourth highest salary in department 60.
--select employee_id,salary,department_id,salary_rank
from (
select employee_id,salary, department_id, dense_rank() over 
(partition by department_id  order by salary desc)
as salary_rank from hr.employees
) where salary_rank=4 and department_id=60;


## 5. Compute the cumulative total salary of employees ordered by hire date.
## Uses SUM() OVER() to create a running total of salaries
--select employee_id,salary,hire_date, SUM(salary) over (order by hire_date)as cumulative_salary 
from hr.employees;

--select employee_id,salary,hire_date, SUM(salary) over (order by HIRE_DATE )as cumulative_salary 
from hr.employees

## 6. Find the salary difference between each employee and the next highest-paid employee.
